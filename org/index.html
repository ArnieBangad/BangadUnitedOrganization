            Somalian Drought: Displaced but holding on to hope
            <br>
            <br>
                 -It has been dry in Somalia for more than 8 years. It does not rain, and when there is not enough water, people cannot harvest enough food and go hungry. Now, with the new year, the drought continues.
                  In Bosaaso, in northern Somalia, there are extreme water shortages. Due to a lack of food, loss of livestock, a lack of water and insecurity from armed groups, more than
                 49,000 Somalis fled from other parts of the country into Bosaaso’s camps for internally displaced people. Some go to these camps in hopes of receiving humanitarian aid and others, to join relatives already there.

             What Trump Didn’t Say About Afghanistan In His State of the Union Address
                  -In America’s longest recent State of the Union Address, President Trump devoted just 34 words to America’s longest war – the conflict in Afghanistan. He talked exclusively in military terms. I wish the President had found a few more words to avoid an ominous omission. 
                   The critical capacity for long term victory isn’t ultimately a soldier in a Humvee, it’s a young Afghan woman in a classroom.
                   Troop levels have risen, fallen, and risen again through three presidencies, but if you seek long term stability, then completing the job of investing in Afghanistan's women and girls is the only real exit strategy.

             Working for peace in Yemen in 2018
               -CARE Yemen Communications Assistant Abdulhakim Al-Ansi recounts his experience returning to Yemen since war broke out in his country and his hopes for the future.
                2017 was not a good year for Yemen. For me, it was the year I returned to my home country. In January, after having worked and studied abroad for four years 
                I arrived at Aden Airport. Of course, I knew that there is a war in my country for almost three years, but, I was still completely shocked by what I saw. The building of the airport was destroyed.
                Tanks were roaming around the airstrip.
                On the way back to Sana’a, I was horrified by the damaged buildings, hotels, houses, schools and roads. It was the first time for me to travel from
                Aden to Sana’a and not be able to go through my home city Taiz. For almost three years the city where I was born and lived my best days, has experienced unmerciful conflict.
