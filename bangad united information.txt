   WHAT WE DO
           -We’re on the ground in the Philippines, too, working out of offices in cities near you to raise crucial 
            funds and fight for policy changes that affect people all over the world. Look us up!  
   FEATURES
           -CARE is helping girls get a lifesaving education, and we are partnering with Alba Botanica®, Avalon Organics® and JASÖN® to do it.
            By partnering to advance CARE’s girls education and leadership work to reach marginalized girls not just in Guatemala but across the globe, 
            we help hundreds of girls access quality and equitable education 
            
           -Each brand has an area of unique interest in helping CARE change the circumstances of so many:
               Alba Botanica® is all about girl power, and is working with CARE to find ways to unlock it.
                 Avalon Organics® believes, along with CARE, that girls from all backgrounds should have access to education, so we are
                 working to advocate for changes in local and government-level policy to make this possible.
                 JASÖN® is standing with CARE, helping mothers and communities shape bright futures for girls as they strive to do more.
    HEALTH
            -And we support it. Increased investment, targeted programming and supportive policies are all critical to meeting the reproductive 
             health needs of millions of women and men. CARE believes that access to sexual, reproductive and maternal health services is both a 
             fundamental human right and a critical development issue. Supporting sexual, 
             reproductive and maternal health and rights is therefore central to CARE’s commitment to gender equality and reducing global poverty.

EMERGENCIES:
             
          PREPARING FOR DISASTER
            -Every year, CARE responds to approximately 30 disasters that affect the lives of 11-12 million people around the world.

             With emergency-response experts on the ground in 69 countries — 95 percent of them citizens of those areas — we provide emergency food, relief supplies, water and sanitation and shelter to survivors.

             But for poor and vulnerable communities, the impact of any emergency can destroy hard-won gains in the fight against poverty.

             CARE helps people strengthen community resilience to prepare for and respond to disasters — anything from cyclones in Asia, to food shortages in Africa.
  
             As with our everyday work, in emergencies, every dollar counts. To ensure that we don’t have to divert funds from our other important programs, we rely on support from donors like you so we can mobilize the instant disaster strikes.

OUR IMPACT
         STORIES
            Somalian Drought: Displaced but holding on to hope
                 -It has been dry in Somalia for more than 8 years. It does not rain, and when there is not enough water, people cannot harvest enough food and go hungry. Now, with the new year, the drought continues.
                  In Bosaaso, in northern Somalia, there are extreme water shortages. Due to a lack of food, loss of livestock, a lack of water and insecurity from armed groups, more than
                 49,000 Somalis fled from other parts of the country into Bosaaso’s camps for internally displaced people. Some go to these camps in hopes of receiving humanitarian aid and others, to join relatives already there.

             What Trump Didn’t Say About Afghanistan In His State of the Union Address
                  -In America’s longest recent State of the Union Address, President Trump devoted just 34 words to America’s longest war – the conflict in Afghanistan. He talked exclusively in military terms. I wish the President had found a few more words to avoid an ominous omission. 
                   The critical capacity for long term victory isn’t ultimately a soldier in a Humvee, it’s a young Afghan woman in a classroom.
                   Troop levels have risen, fallen, and risen again through three presidencies, but if you seek long term stability, then completing the job of investing in Afghanistan's women and girls is the only real exit strategy.

	    
             Myanmar Refugee Crisis: Malnourished children receive desperately needed therapeutic food
 	      -Mohammed is from a northern town in Myanmar. He is married to Jannat. As well as their one-year-old daughter, Umme, the couple have three sons aged three, four and five-years. 
             The family fled violence in Myanmar and arrived in Bangladesh. 
             Today, he has brought daughter Umme to the Outpatient Therapeutic Programme (OTP) clinic in Balukhali camp, where the family currently reside in a makeshift shelter. 
             Plabon Sankon is a technical coordinator at the clinic.CARE is providing technical assistance to the outpatient clinic, as part of a community based management of child malnutrition program (CMAM) consortium (Concern Worldwide, SHED and SARPV)
             funded by UNICEF. The clinic provides high nutrient food and treatment for children aged six-months to five-years. The clinic opened on 24 September, and has been open every day since. 


             Working for peace in Yemen in 2018
               -CARE Yemen Communications Assistant Abdulhakim Al-Ansi recounts his experience returning to Yemen since war broke out in his country and his hopes for the future.
                2017 was not a good year for Yemen. For me, it was the year I returned to my home country. In January, after having worked and studied abroad for four years 
                I arrived at Aden Airport. Of course, I knew that there is a war in my country for almost three years, but, I was still completely shocked by what I saw. The building of the airport was destroyed.
                Tanks were roaming around the airstrip.
                On the way back to Sana’a, I was horrified by the damaged buildings, hotels, houses, schools and roads. It was the first time for me to travel from
                Aden to Sana’a and not be able to go through my home city Taiz. For almost three years the city where I was born and lived my best days, has experienced unmerciful conflict.
